# What I've Learned
Throughout the development of this project, I've gained valuable experience and skills, including:

Web Development: Understanding the intricacies of building a responsive and interactive website using modern web technologies.

User Experience Design: Enhancing the user experience through intuitive navigation, responsive design, and engaging content presentation.

Version Control: I have had more insight into the use of Git and Github. That is how to fork a repository, make a commit, and make a pull request. Furthermore, some mistakes led me to do further research, like how to undo a commit, revert and reset a commit, and also how to delete a repository.
